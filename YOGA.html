<p class="p1">&lt;h1&gt;Discovering Yoga&lt;/h1&gt;</p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">&lt;p&gt;Yoga ( </span><span class="s2">Sanskrit</span><span class="s1">: </span><span class="s3">योग</span><span class="s1">;) is a group of &lt;i lang="ang"&gt;</span><span class="s2">physical</span><span class="s1">&lt;/i&gt;, </span><span class="s2">mental</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s2">spiritual</span><span class="s1"> practices or disciplines which originated in </span><span class="s2">ancient India</span><span class="s1">. Yoga is one of the six orthodox schools of </span><span class="s2">Hindu philosophical traditions</span><span class="s1">. There is a broad variety of yoga schools, practices, and goals in </span><span class="s2">Hinduism</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s2">Buddhism</span><span class="s1">, and </span><span class="s2">Jainism</span><span class="s1">. The term "yoga" in the Western world often denotes a modern form of </span><span class="s2">Hatha yoga</span><span class="s1">, </span><span class="s2">yoga as exercise</span><span class="s1">, consisting largely of the postures called </span><span class="s2">asanas</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The origins of yoga have been speculated to date back to pre-</span><span class="s2">Vedic</span><span class="s1"> </span><span class="s2">Indian</span><span class="s1"> traditions; it is mentioned in the </span><span class="s2">Rigveda</span><span class="s1">, but most likely developed around the sixth and fifth centuries BCE, in ancient India's </span><span class="s2">ascetic</span><span class="s1"> and </span><span class="s2">śramaṇa</span><span class="s1"> movements. The chronology of earliest texts describing yoga-practices is unclear, varyingly credited to </span><span class="s2">Upanishads</span><span class="s1">. The </span><span class="s2"><i>Yoga Sutras of Patanjali</i></span><span class="s1"> date from the first half of the 1st millennium CE, and gained prominence in the West in the 20th century. Hatha yoga texts emerged sometimes between the 9th and 11th century with origins in </span><span class="s2">tantra</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">Yoga gurus from India later introduced yoga to the West, following the success of </span><span class="s2">Swami Vivekananda</span><span class="s1"> in the late 19th and early 20th century with his adaptation of yoga tradition, excluding asanas. Outside India, it has developed into </span><span class="s2">a posture-based physical fitness, stress-relief and relaxation technique</span><span class="s1">. Yoga in Indian traditions, however, is more than physical exercise; it has a meditative and spiritual core. One of the six major orthodox schools of Hinduism is also called </span><span class="s2">Yoga</span><span class="s1">, which has its own epistemology and metaphysics, and is closely related to Hindu </span><span class="s2">Samkhya</span><span class="s1"> philosophy.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s1">The impact of postural yoga on physical and mental health has been a topic of systematic studies, with evidence that regular yoga practice yields benefits for low back pain and stress.</span><span class="s2"><sup> </sup></span><span class="s1">In 2017, a Cochrane review found low</span><span class="s3">‐</span><span class="s1"> to moderate</span><span class="s3">‐</span><span class="s1">certainty evidence that yoga improved back function compared to non-exercise. On December 1, 2016, yoga was listed by </span><span class="s2">UNESCO</span><span class="s1"> as an </span><span class="s2">intangible cultural heritage</span><span class="s1">.</span></p>
